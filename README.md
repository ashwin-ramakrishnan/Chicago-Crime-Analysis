# Chicago-Crime-Analysis

1. Introduction

1.1 Background 

Understanding how to control crime is important because exposures to violence and crime have been unusually high in the U.S. for several decades and, while declining, they remain high. Over half a million children and youth aged 10-24 years were treated in 2012 in emergency departments for nonfatal physical assault injuries related to gun shots, cuts and stabbings, among others. Understanding the neighborhood context of crime is particularly important because victimization and other forms of crime exposures have many severe consequences.  
An optimal allocation of preventive forces can lead to lower crime rates, cost-effective solutions, and better public safety. Therefore, we would like to learn if there are observable patterns in criminal activity. Based on the information we get, we would like to predict the probability of a criminal activity based on time and location.
